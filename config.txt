"nbin_size" refers to how many nucleotides each bin is in the initial SOR read histogram
used to filter out potential clusters. Too large, and signals may become mixed together.
Too small, and signals may be split. This value should be changed according to how large
of a inversion pair you are looking for.

"cbin_cutoff" refers to what percentile of read count an individual bin within a cluster
must have to be considered a site for potential inversion nucleotides. I'd keep this at 98

"cbin_size" refers to how many nucleotides is in each bin within a potential cluster. 40
has been working for me so far, but you can adjust is larger or smaller based on how messy
and how close together individual peaks are. For example, if I had a super messy peak at
position 10000, and another at 10002, it may be nice to have a cbin_size of at least two
so these are combined together, and not mistaken for an inversion pair of 2 nt.

"cluster_min_sep" and "cluster_max_sep" refer to how many nucleotides should be expected
between the two highest-scoring bins within a potential cluster - so, at least cluster_min_sep
and no more than cluster_max_sep. This again helps the program know what size of inversion
clusters you are looking for.

"ntpair_min_sep" and "ntpair_max_sep" are like the above, but look at the distances of the
final exact nt positions. Sometimes, when two clusters are identified, the best positions
are at the respective beginning and end of a cluster. So, this makes sure you have the size
of inversion pair you want at the end.

"max_genes" refers to how may genes you want on the final gene diagrams.
